# Manual-PCA-TSNE
I tried to code a manual version of the famous PCA algorithm to reduce the dimensions of mnist dataset.

I also tried TSNE separately on mnist to visualize the dataset better.

It is recommended to use a dimensionality reduction algorithms on datasets before applying TSNE.
For more info you can visit [scikit-learn TSNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html)
